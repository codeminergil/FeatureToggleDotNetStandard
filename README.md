This is a functional feature toggle library that the team uses for internal and client projects. The first version has basic functionality 
and will be extended over time and will also include .NET Core support.

# Examples

The unit tests show examples of how to use the library. You are free to use magic strings or strong types as the flag keys or 'ToggleIds'
